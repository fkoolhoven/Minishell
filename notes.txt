To Felicia:
- Figure out signals
- Fix norminette
- Rewrite pointer stuff in parser to be more readable
- Figure out error handling for token/expand/parse
- Check for mem leaks if expand can't find var
- Test thoroughly for mem leaks at errors
- Merge master with expander branch
- Check for syntax errors? Test with bash
